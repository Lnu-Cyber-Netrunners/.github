## About Us 📚


Welcome to the Lnu-Cyber-Netrunners profile! We are a passionate group of students 🎓 who are actively studying and exploring the world of cybersecurity. Our journey in this exciting field began in 2018 when we introduced the internal specialization "Cybersecurity and Data Protection" within the framework of the Computer Science program at our university.


In the following year, we achieved a significant milestone when we obtained a license from the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine to offer a bachelor's level program in Cybersecurity 🛡️. This marked the official recognition of our commitment to educating the next generation of cybersecurity experts.


## Our Mission 🚀


Our mission is to prepare students for the dynamic and challenging field of cybersecurity. We aim to equip them with the knowledge and skills required to tackle cybersecurity threats effectively. As students ourselves, we understand the importance of hands-on experience, and that's why our GitLab group hosts a variety of projects that showcase our learning journey.

## Opportunities and Prospects 💼


The world of cybersecurity is evolving rapidly, with increasing specialization and growing demand for skilled professionals. From financial institutions to service providers and even government agencies, the need for cybersecurity expertise is evident. In Ukraine, organizations such as the Cyber Police, the Security Service of Ukraine, and the Armed Forces also rely on cybersecurity professionals to protect critical assets.

We are proud to announce that this year marks the first graduation of our bachelor's program in cybersecurity. Our graduates have a wide range of employment opportunities and promising future prospects as they step into the exciting and ever-evolving world of cybersecurity.
